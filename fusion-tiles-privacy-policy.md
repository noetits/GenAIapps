Privacy Policy for Fusion Tiles
Effective Date: June 23, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how GenAIapps ("we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our mobile game, "Fusion Tiles" (the "App").

1. Information We Do NOT Collect
We want to be clear: "Fusion Tiles" does not collect any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from you, such as your name, email address, phone number, or precise geographical location. The App also does not integrate any third-party services for advertising or analytics that would collect data.

Your gameplay data (scores, board states) is stored solely locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers or any other external entity.

2. How We Use Information
Since "Fusion Tiles" does not collect any personal information or integrate with third-party services that do, we do not have any user data to use or process. The App's functionality is entirely self-contained on your device.

3. Local Storage (Device-Specific Data)
The App stores your "Best Score" and the current game state locally on your device using your browser's local storage mechanism (when running as a web app, or equivalent for packaged mobile apps). This data is never transmitted to us or any third parties. If you uninstall the app, clear your device's storage, or clear your browser's data, this local data will be lost.

4. Children's Privacy
"Fusion Tiles" is a general audience game. As we do not collect any Personally Identifiable Information from any users, this applies equally to children. We are committed to protecting the privacy of all users, including children, by not collecting personal data.

5. Data Security
We take reasonable measures to ensure that no unauthorized collection or transmission of data occurs through our App. As the App does not collect or transmit personal information, the primary data security relates to the integrity of the App itself on your device.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
